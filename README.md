#HTML & CSS - Course Assignment: Mobile-responsive website
## Goal
###### Get used to coding for mobile first.
## Brief
###### Build an HTML website for a company called 'Re-cycle' that offer eco-friendly, guided cycling tours of a town. Because their clients are travelling, it is very important that the website is mobile responsive.
It should have 4 pages: home page, about us, contact us, and the list of routes/tours. Do not use Bootstrap or another similar framework - we want to see your ability to create responsive layouts using CSS.
